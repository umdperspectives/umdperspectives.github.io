  <li>
    <p>I think that the thing I value most in life is free will. I think that people should be able to make their own decisions without interference from anybody else. A lot of people ask why I say this (I’m libertarian), but I’m just scared of being controlled. I don’t like the idea of being controlled, and I don’t want the government controlling my decisions. I’d honestly have an anarchy rather than a communist institution. An example is gay marriage. I support the legalization of it, but I personally don’t support it. I wouldn’t personally do it and I wouldn’t advise someone to do it, because it goes against my religious beliefs, but if some other adult wanted to do it, who am I to say no? That’s another thing, it’s sort of like playing God. If people ask me if it’s right, I’ll tell them what I think, but at the end of the day, they’re entitled to their own decisions, and I can’t force them into not doing something, because that is inhibiting their free will. I feel like a good Christian whould not force people to do things that the Bible tells you  to do, but instead, inform them peacefully and thoroughly why you believe it is right biblically. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say success, maybe on a more worldly level, is financial stability. Not necessarily rich, but living comfortably within my means would be successful. Living a more biblically correct life, closer to what Jesus would do, you know?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I’ve already covered my goals in what I’ve said in the previous question. I kind of want to get involved in politics, maybe purport my view of free will. You can’t run a political platform on that, but I would promote free will through the values and policies that I come up with.</p>

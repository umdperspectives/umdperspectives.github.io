    <p>I see that there’s a lot of chaos, a lot of wars, a lot of conflict. I don’t want to be too pessimistic, but yeah, there’s a lot. There’s also a lot of injustice. I’m in a position of privilege where I don’t have to deal with as much poverty, and war, etc… so it’s tricky to judge. I would say I am lucky to be in the position that I am. Right now, I feel that I’m not contributing improving the overall situation of the world. There is a dual purpose: one is to get by, and the other to improve things. And since I’m an engineer I guess I can contribute to the wellness of the world but right now it’s not happening. I’m still a student and I’m still figuring out how to graduate and get by, and I have to do this before I move on. But definitely at some point I want to contribute back to society.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that I am successful, because I don’t think that I’ve failed. I’d say that I’m succeeding. I am here at the university and I’m part of the PhD program. I’m progressing towards my goals, so I can see myself as successful. I mean, I don’t have a million dollars, but I think I’m successful. You don’t have to be rich to be successful. I’m always at the edge because I’d like to do better, but I’m optimistic about things improving overall.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finish my PhD. That’s my first priority. I’d like to have a career in which I can make creative things, interesting things. I want to have time for my family, visit interesting places, interesting people. I’d like to have some security for retirement, so that when I can no longer work I can still continue living a peaceful life. I hope not to become a burden to my family and society, to still be able to sustain myself.</p>

1. I wanna say, "treat others how you want to be treated", but that's cheesy. I think you should give and expect nothing in return.

2. I would feel successful right after graduating college, because I will have gone through many internships and experienced a real-life world. Basically what I would say success is, being able to live a stress free, happy life, while providing for yourself. And, having close relationships with people you can depend on.

3. Marry rich and die young haha just kidding. Probably, gradauate from college. Find a stable job that I enjoy doing. Start a fami - travel the world, then start a family. Oh, also those are like my main goals. I'd also like to help those in need and those who have helped me in the past. I want to be someone that people can depend on, and go to when they need advice.

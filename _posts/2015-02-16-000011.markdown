1. I think you should always be doing the right thing, maintaining the integrity of your work. Whatever you're doing should be helping people. I think you should work until you can't work anymore. I think you have to be patient and kind with everyone you meet.

2. I think I'm always successful. Successful before, now, and in the future. And I think that my state of mind leads me to thinking this way. I'm always doing something that I think is worthwhile, that has an impact, and I'm doing it well. As long as I'm doing that, I feel successful.

3. Goals in life are... to make the world a better, more efficient, more sustainable place through developing creative, impactful tools and generating versatile machines.

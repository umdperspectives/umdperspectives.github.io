1. I have a Christian biblical perspective. I believe that humans are placed on Earth for glorifying their creator.

2. With regards to success, I’m currently in progress. For my worldview, I’m figuratively walking the path that God set for me. I’m achieving success through following God’s path.

3. I would define my goals as two categories: my ultimate goal, no matter what my plans are, is to fulfill God’s plan for my life. But, since I don’t necessarily have a timeline of what I’m going to do, my personal goals would be to have a stable job (that I enjoy), where I feel like I’m making some kind of difference, and to have a healthy happy family, be a healthy active person, and to have a balanced life.

This is a blog about perspectives.

I'm a student at the University of Maryland, College Park. 

There are several reasons why I started this project. One of them is that I can't fully answer the questions that I'm asking. In a sense, I'm asking you guys to enlighten me. Secondly, I feel that I could be a much kinder and more open person. And thirdly, I'm just curious to see what others have to say. I think there's always something to be taken away from stepping into someone else's shoes.

The questions are as follows:

1. What is your worldview, your philosophy, your take on life? Whatâ€™s your perspective?
2. At what point personally would you call yourself successful? What state would be at, what will you have accomplished?
3. What are your goals in life?

I hope your responses in the upcoming posts will stir our thoughts up, offer some interesting insight, and inspire us to live life to the fullest. Best regards,
